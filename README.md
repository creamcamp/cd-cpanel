## Prerequisites
The purpose of this repository is to study the Continuous deployment principles and best practices through combining the Github Actions experience with working and testing [Reaktive Cli](https://docs.cream.camp/structure/reaktive-cli/getting-started). Some code bits may contain unreasonable code, so please be aware that the essential purpose is not to come up with a business demo, but **just** to study and be aware of working processes
